# CarryMyBaby
"Carry My Baby!" is a 2D co-op game. You play as a married couple, Karen and Bob, who found themselves in the middle of a situation with 
the Child Protective Service (CPS) over the custody of their own child. You must cooperate to keep the baby in check as well as fixing 
the house's many issues before the arrival of the CPS investigators. 

To run the game, please find the executable file in the Executable folder.
The project file is located in the Project folder.
